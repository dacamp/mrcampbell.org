## WORKFLOW TIPS

1. **Generate 2-3 variations** per prompt to select best fit
2. **Test with text overlays** on actual website sections
3. **Optimize file size** to <300KB for web performance
4. **Verify mobile responsive** appearance at various breakpoints
5. **Check accessibility** - ensure sufficient contrast for overlaid text
